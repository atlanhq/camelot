# Camelot: PDF Table Extraction for Humans

**Camelot** is a Python library which makes it easy for *anyone* to extract tables from PDF files!

---

**Here's how you can extract tables from PDF files.** Check out the PDF used in this example, [here](https://github.com/socialcopsdev/camelot/blob/master/docs/_static/pdf/foo.pdf).

<pre>
>>> import camelot
>>> tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
>>> tables
&lt;TableList n=1&gt;
>>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html
>>> tables[0]
&lt;Table shape=(7, 7)&gt;
>>> tables[0].parsing_report
{
    'accuracy': 99.02,
    'whitespace': 12.24,
    'order': 1,
    'page': 1
}
>>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html
>>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
</pre>

There's a [command-line interface](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html) too!

**Note:** Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. If you can click-and-drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based.

## Why Camelot?

- **You are in control**: Unlike other libraries and tools which either give a nice output or fail miserably (with no in-between), Camelot gives you the power to tweak table extraction. (Since everything in the real world, including PDF table extraction, is fuzzy.)
- **Metrics**: *Bad* tables can be discarded based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without ever having to manually look at each table.
- Each table is a **pandas DataFrame**, which enables seamless integration into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873).
- **Export** to multiple formats, including json, excel and html.

## Installation

After [installing the dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html) ([tk](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/python-tk) and [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)), you can simply use pip to install Camelot:

<pre>
$ pip install camelot-py
</pre>

### Alternatively

After [installing the dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html), clone the repo using:
