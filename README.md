**Camelot** is a Python library that makes it easy for *anyone* to extract tables from PDF files!

**Note:** You can also check out [Excalibur](https://github.com/camelot-dev/excalibur), which is a web interface for Camelot!

---

**Here's how you can extract tables from PDF files.** Check out the PDF used in this example [here](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/master/docs/_static/pdf/foo.pdf).

<pre>
>>> import camelot
>>> tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
>>> tables
&lt;TableList n=1&gt;
>>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, sqlite
>>> tables[0]
&lt;Table shape=(7, 7)&gt;
>>> tables[0].parsing_report
{
    'accuracy': 99.02,
    'whitespace': 12.24,
    'order': 1,
    'page': 1
}
>>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_sqlite
>>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
</pre>

There's a [command-line interface](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/cli.html) too!

**Note:** Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

## Why Camelot?

- **You are in control.**: Unlike other libraries and tools which either give a nice output or fail miserably (with no in-between), Camelot gives you the power to tweak table extraction. (This is important since everything in the real world, including PDF table extraction, is fuzzy.)
- *Bad* tables can be discarded based on **metrics** like accuracy and whitespace, without ever having to manually look at each table.
- Each table is a **pandas DataFrame**, which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873).
- **Export** to multiple formats, including JSON, Excel, HTML and Sqlite.
