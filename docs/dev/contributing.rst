Contributor's Guide
===================

If you're reading this, you're probably looking to contributing to Camelot. *Time is the only real currency*, and the fact that you're considering spending some here is *very* generous of you. Thank you very much!

This document will help you get started with contributing documentation, code, testing and filing issues. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to `Vinayak Mehta`_, the author and maintainer.

Code Of Conduct
---------------

The following quote sums up the **Code Of Conduct**.

    **Be cordial or be on your way**. *--Kenneth Reitz*

Kenneth Reitz has also written an `essay`_ on this topic, which you should read.

.. _essay: https://www.kennethreitz.org/essays/be-cordial-or-be-on-your-way

As the `Requests Code Of Conduct`_ states, **all contributions are welcome**, as long as everyone involved is treated with respect.

.. _Requests Code Of Conduct: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/dev/contributing/#be-cordial

Your first contribution
-----------------------

A great way to start contributing to Camelot is to pick an issue tagged with the `help wanted`_ or the `good first issue`_ tags. If you're unable to find a good first issue, feel free to contact the maintainer.

.. _help wanted: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/labels/help%20wanted
.. _good first issue: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/labels/good%20first%20issue

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

To install the dependencies needed for development, you can use pip::

    $ pip install camelot-py[dev]

Alternatively, you can clone the project repository, and install using pip::

    $ pip install ".[dev]"

Pull Requests
-------------

Submit a pull request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The preferred workflow for contributing to Camelot is to fork the `project repository`_ on GitHub, clone, develop on a branch and then finally submit a pull request. Here are the steps:

.. _project repository: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot

1. Fork the project repository. Click on the ‘Fork’ button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub.

2. Clone your fork of Camelot from your GitHub account::

    $ git clone https://www.github.com/[username]/camelot

3. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    $ git checkout -b my-feature

Always branch out from ``master`` to work on your contribution. It's good practice to never work on the ``master`` branch!

.. note:: ``git stash`` is a great way to save the work that you haven't committed yet, to move between branches.

4. Work on your contribution. Add changed files using ``git add`` and then ``git commit`` them::

    $ git add modified_files
    $ git commit

5. Finally, push them to your GitHub fork::

    $ git push -u origin my-feature

Now it's time to go to the your fork of Camelot and create a pull request! You can `follow these instructions`_ to do the same.

.. _follow these instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/

Work on your pull request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend that your pull request complies with the following guidelines:

- Make sure your code follows `pep8`_.

.. _pep8: http://pep8.org

- In case your pull request contains function docstrings, make sure you follow the `numpydoc`_ format. All function docstrings in Camelot follow this format. Following the format will make sure that the API documentation is generated flawlessly.

.. _numpydoc: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

- Make sure your commit messages follow `the seven rules of a great git commit message`_:
    - Separate subject from body with a blank line
    - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    - Capitalize the subject line
    - Do not end the subject line with a period
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    - Wrap the body at 72 characters
    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

.. _the seven rules of a great git commit message: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

- Please prefix your title of your pull request with [MRG] (Ready for Merge), if the contribution is complete and ready for a detailed review. An incomplete pull request's title should be prefixed with [WIP] (to indicate a work in progress), and changed to [MRG] when it's complete. A good `task list`_ in the PR description will ensure that other people get a fair idea of what it proposes to do, which will also increase collaboration.

.. _task list: https://blog.github.com/2013-01-09-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments/

- If contributing new functionality, make sure that you add a unit test for it, while making sure that all previous tests pass. Camelot uses `pytest`_ for testing. Tests can be run using:

.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

::

    $ python setup.py test

Writing Documentation
---------------------

Writing documentation, function docstrings, examples and tutorials is a great way to start contributing to open-source software! The documentation is present inside the ``docs/`` directory of the source code repository.

The documentation is written in `reStructuredText`_, with `Sphinx`_ used to generate these lovely HTML files that you're currently reading (unless you're reading this on GitHub). You can edit the documentation using any text editor and then generate the HTML output by running `make html` in the ``docs/`` directory.

The function docstrings are written using the `numpydoc`_ extension for Sphinx. Make sure you check out how its format guidelines before you start writing one.

.. _reStructuredText: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText
.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
.. _numpydoc: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

Filing Issues
-------------

We use `GitHub issues`_ to keep track of all issues and pull requests. Before opening an issue (which asks a question or reports a bug), please use GitHub search to look for existing issues (both open and closed) that may be similar.

.. _GitHub issues: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/issues

Questions
^^^^^^^^^

Please don't use GitHub issues for support questions. A better place for them would be `Stack Overflow`_. Make sure you tag them using the ``python-camelot`` tag.

.. _Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com

Bug Reports
^^^^^^^^^^^

In bug reports, make sure you include:

- Your operating system type and Python version number, along with the version numbers of NumPy, OpenCV and Camelot. You can use the following code snippet to find this information::

    import platform; print(platform.platform())
    import sys; print('Python', sys.version)
    import numpy; print('NumPy', numpy.__version__)
    import cv2; print('OpenCV', cv2.__version__)
    import camelot; print('Camelot', camelot.__version__)

- The complete traceback. Just adding the exception message or a part of the traceback won't help us fix your issue sooner.

- Steps to reproduce the bug, using code snippets. See `Creating and highlighting code blocks`_.

.. _Creating and highlighting code blocks: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/

- A link to the PDF document that you were trying to extract tables from, telling us what you expected the code to do and what actually happened.
